                <p class="about-me-body"><span>I used to be a pack rat.</span> I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much. </p>
                <p class="about-me-body">Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.</p>
                <h3 class="about-me-subtitle">How I turned things around</h3>
                <p class="about-me-body"><span>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything.</span>I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.  </p>
                <p class="about-me-body">It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.</p>
                <h3 class="about-me-subtitle">Now I live the simple life</h3>
                <p class="about-me-body">Now I live the simple life Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.</p>
                <p class="about-me-body">With how much it turned my life around,<span>I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it</span>, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!</p>
